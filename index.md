ALE stands for **Agile Language Engineering**!
The team contributes to the field of Software Language Engineering, aiming to provide more agility to both language designers and language users.
We explore extreme modularity constructs for the development of Domain-Specific Languages,
and advanced mechanisms for live modeling.

ALE is a research associate team (2017-2022), between
the [DiverSE team](http://diverse.irisa.fr/) at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/) (France) and
the [SWAT team](https://www.cwi.nl/research-groups/software-analysis-and-transformation) at [CWI](https://www.cwi.nl) (The Netherlands).
